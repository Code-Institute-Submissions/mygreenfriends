    "body": "Hanging house plants get a lot more of the good stuff—more light, airflow, and great drainage. But their airborne state also leaves them more vulnerable to water-loss and damage from wayward pets, passersby, and outdoor wind damage. Here are some essential guidelines, for placement, how to care for hanging plants, and repotting, to keep hanging plants happy and make them a highlight of your home décor. Where there is light, you can hang. Some plants need bright direct sunlight, while others need more shade, but overall any bright window is a shoo-in for hanging plants. Place groups of complementary plants of varying sizes at varying heights to create artful collections. Complementary plants should look good together and have the same growing needs. Small hanging pots are perfect for decorating brightly-lit window sills or mantles. Humidity-loving tropicals look pretty cascading above bathtubs or showers where they can enjoy the steam along with you. Large hanging pots make a statement in any spacious sunroom or bright spot in the home. Just be sure that you take into account watering and spill zones. Antique furniture or your most treasured textiles should not reside below or near a hanging house plant.Wherever you place them, make sure hanging plants are away from traffic. An ill-placed pendulous pot is sure to knock a few heads, lose a few stems, and eventually get broken. Cat owners must also keep pots and long stems out of leaping or batting distance, and if you like to take hanging house plants outside in summer, place them in low-wind areas near the home.",

    "body": "While houseplants don’t need a full-time babysitter like pets or children, they do require a bit of water and attention before you leave for a long vacation. Most houseplants will be just fine for a few days without water; however, if you leave for more than a week, you may come back to find your plants wilted or dead. Keep plants from perishing and ensure they receive what they need while you are away with these vacation watering tips.",

    "subtitle": "(Everybody’s Doing It!)",
    "body": "As we all know from experience that communication is a key to building better relationships. There are dog owners, cat owners and even snake enthusiasts, and the one thing they all have in common: they talk to their pets. This creates stronger bonds and helps with living longer and healthier. (Check out our article on fave pet friendly plants!). So, what does that mean for plant parents? If you aren’t already doing it…start talking to your plant babies! According to Michael Pollan’s article “The Intelligent Plant”,  plants have more sensory capabilities than we humans do with our 5 senses. These senses can be stimulated by the plant’s environment, just like a baby in a mother’s belly is stimulated by the sounds of her voice or the music she listens to. By providing an energizing environment through conversation, you’ll encourage the growth of your plants, as well as encourage your own bond with them. Talking to your plants might feel a little strange at first, but over time, and with practice, you’ll be chatting with your green friends probably more than your mother. Just kidding. (Hi mom!)",
